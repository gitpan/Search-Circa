WHAT IS THIS?

This is Circa, a module who provide facilities to build
and use a Perl search engine running with Mysql. 
Circa is for your Web site, or for a list of sites. 
It indexes like Altavista does. It can read, add and 
parse all url's found in a page. It add url and word 
to MySQL for use it at search.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

You need the following modules : DBI, DBD-Mysql, 
LWP::RobotUA, URI::URL and HTML::Parser 3.0 if you can. 
Else a defaut parser will be used.

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains 
this README file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have trouble installing Circa because you 
have insufficient access privileges to add to the perl 
library directory, you can still use Circa.  
Use the directive use lib '/home/account/mylib';
See the docs in directory demo for details.

Then, for use script, see demo/INSTALL

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

You'll find very verbose documentation in the file 
Indexer.pm in POD format

When you install Circa::Indexer, the MakeMaker program 
will automatically install the manual pages for you 
(on Unix systems, type "man Circa::Indexer").

WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?

A collection of examples demonstrating various features 
and techniques are in the directory "demo". You can use 
admin.pl on command line or admin.cgi with CGI.

Have fun, and let me know how it turns out!
